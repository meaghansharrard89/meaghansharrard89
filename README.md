<h1>Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Meaghan</h1>
<h2>A creative and artistic developer in Northern California</h2>
<h3>About me:</h3>
<p>I have over 15 years background as a customer support professional, including in the tech field where I developed skills and worked closely with the Engineering team. Working adjacently with people currently in the software engineering field led to me to pursue Flatiron School's Full-Stack Software Engineering program, which I am currently attending.

In addition to customer support, I also have skills in social media, fundraising, marketing, and a history as a Sign Artist at Trader Joeâ€™s, where I designed visually-appealing and eye-catching artwork to help properly market items.</p>
